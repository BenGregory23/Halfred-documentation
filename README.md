# Introduction



The SKOP API is a javascript library for one-to-one video calls between a **patient** and a **doctor**. The goal of the API is to take advantage of the [SKOP]("https://www.wemed.fr/product-page/skop"). It's a connected stethoscope that can be used to listen to the patient's heart or lungs. This enables any doctor to have online appointments and still have a similar (or even better) sound quality than with a normal stethoscope.
One of the key features of the API is the possibility of using **augmented reality** to help the patient place the SKOP on his chest. When the doctor chooses a focus we use augmented reality to draw on the patient the **exact position** of this focus. The focus is also visible from the Doctor's perspective, this reassures the Doctor that the focus is drawn at the right location.


**Important** : To use the API, you need to have registered API_KEY. If you don't have one, please go [here](https://www.wemed.fr/inscription-api-skop) to get one.
