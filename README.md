# Introduction

## Skop API

The Skop API is a javascript library for one-to-one video calls between a **patient** and a **doctor** while using a connected stethoscope called the Skop. <br>
Thanks to the latter the doctor can listen to the patient heart for example.
<br>

One of the key points of this API is that we wanted it to be easy to use and implement.  <br>
We have been able to achieve this by reducing the number of methods needed to make it work.




> **Note** : Both the API and the documentation are currently under development.
